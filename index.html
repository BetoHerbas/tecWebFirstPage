      <h2>What is the Mandelbrot set?</h2>
      <p>The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0, i.e., for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value. The set is closely related to Julia sets (which include similarly complex shapes) and is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it.</p>
